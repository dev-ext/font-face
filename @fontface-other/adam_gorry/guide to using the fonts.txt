ADAM GORRY INLINE & ADAM GORRY LIGHTS from Sentinel Type, designed by James Arboghast

Thanks for downloading the Adam Gorry font package. A matching duo, AG Lights mimics the giant light bulb lettering used on theatre billboards, and AG Inline is a traditional inline type. Both fonts are designed strictly for display use, and only perform well at large and larger sizes; text use and small sizes will invariably produce unsatisfactory results.

The AG duo are named after a very special boy, Adam Gorry, of Dorset, England. In 1997, Adam at age 3 was diagnosed with Leukaemi. In 2002 he beat it and is now a healthy, happy growing lad. Specialist care, chemotherapy and the love of Adam's family helped immensely. I decided to dedicate these fonts to Adam as a way of reminding us regular folks how fragile human life can be, and the ongoing need for research to beat this and other crippling disorders. So if you use these fonts please make a cash donation to a Leukaemia foundation or research fund of your choice. Your donation will make a difference.

For detailed information on conditions of use, please read the End User License Agreement included in the font package.

More About the Fonts

Many variations of these two decorative display type styles have existed for approximately a century. Most are similar to the AG pair but plainer, or of the retro variety (1940's - 1950's roadside diner or 'Hotel Reno' style). The AG duo differ with semicircular stroke ends and dual upper case letter set, including some useful alternates and ligatures.
